## Tree Sitter

I maintain and contribute to various tree-sitter repositories.
I've created several in hopes of having grammars for (nearly) every language.

## Personal Projects

A lot of my free-time nowadays goes to either tree-sitter parser development and maintenance or personal projects.
My personal projects tend to revolve around Rust, Linux, Neovim, Reverse Engineering, or Clash of Clans.

I am also an embedded software/hardware enthusiast and love to dabble in assembly code
(namely the ARM family due to Android reversing).
